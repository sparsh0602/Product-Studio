This means our designers will do the heavy lifting until your prototype is ready, after which our developers take over, and eventually our testers step in. We usually offer our clients a payment method that corresponds to the milestones achieved.</p>
                                    <p><span>b.</span>  In our Staff augmentation model, you can supplement your existing staff with one of our team members on an ongoing basis. We've even had our developers be part of a one-man engineering team for some clients. In this model, you will have exclusive access to that particular team member's time. </p>
                                    <p><span>c.</span>  Technical consultations are everything in between - short-term research projects, maintenance assignments, an addition of a new feature, or spec-writing, to quote a few examples.</p>
